# RLGO - Special thanks to Benjiinator for inspiring this project.
## Setup
1. Download the Memory.dll and RLGO.exe and put them in the same folder.
2. Start RLGO.exe.
3. Fill in the fields listed. Note: Times are in seconds and numpad keys are picked by typing numX in the Macro Fields.
   Example: num3 for numpad3 key.
   Valid Macro keys are 0-9, numpad0-9, -, = 
4. If you want to have a different scene for when you enter replay cam, then check the box and enter the key you have bound to that scene. (You might want to do this to prevent a scoreboard overlay from looking out of place)
4. Done!
